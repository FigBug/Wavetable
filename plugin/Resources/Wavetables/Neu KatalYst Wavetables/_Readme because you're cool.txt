Hey, it's Neu KatalYst:

Thanks for downloading these wavetables! They were 
originally made a couple of years ago
for some Vital presets using single-cycle waves 
in Serum, now further "remastered" using
Phase Plant for full interpolation in Wavetable 
(or any other wavetable synth) for OSC 176.

Each wavetable is an interpolation of three 
random single-cycle waves, and assigned
namesake titles. The idea is to pick words 
that speak to you, based on the type of 
sound you're creating - for example, think 
of what a lead using the "CHEMICAL" and/or 
"FRESH" tables might sound like*!

*The purpose for this is to prevent any
overthinking of wavetable selection, and are not
necessarily representative of wavetable sound or
contents. Commit to your imagination~

Enjoy! And feel free to use them in all your 
other synths, including Serum, Vital, Surge,
Phase Plant, Dune, Pigments, Sektor, Union, etc -
no credit necessary, but always welcome.
